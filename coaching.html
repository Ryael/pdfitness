                        Premium Coaching is a private personal training experience that gives you 100% dedicated time with your personal trainer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You receive the privacy of a fully-equipped training studio. This appeals to two types of clients:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Clients who lack confidence and may feel anxious in a commercial gym environment without supervision from a personal trainer
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sports-specific clients who require our full attention to work on a set goal.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        You will receive consistent support to your training, your nutrition and mindset. If you feel that you have been going around in circles and you feel you have got nowhere then a structured coaching plan is
                        recommended for you.

                    <p>
                        You will receive consistent support in your training, your nutrition and mindset. If you feel that you have been going around in circles without direction, then a structured coaching plan is recommended for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a private studio session with your coach, you will go through strategic planning, creating a roadmap, addressing any issues, and overcoming any battles you may come up against during your fitness journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a list of what you will gain in your premium plan:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            One-to-one coaching in the studio (structured times throughout the week)
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <p class="text-title">
                        Semi-Private is an exciting new way to train as the training involves a small group of people. The group environment will inspire you to keep going when it gets tough and reduces the per-person cost which makes it
                        more cost effective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are coached through your program in a small group of like-minded people with everyone having a programme tailored specifically to them. It is a beautiful mix of personal coaching & community that develops both
                        autonomy and a sense of togetherness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will gain a bespoke programme based on your goals and fitness level. Through camaraderie with like-minded people, you will gain accountability and consistency and will stay on track with your fitness goals. As
                        the groups are designed to be small, dedicated time with your coach will still be provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the group environment, you have access to several training sessions a week as opposed to one or two. This is a great way to improve techniques or expedite your goals.
