                <p class="text-title">
                    Premium Coaching is a private personal training experience that gives you 100% dedicated time with
                    your personal trainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You receive the privacy of a fully-equipped training studio. This appeals to two types of clients:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Clients who lack confidence and may feel anxious in a commercial gym environment without
                        supervision from a personal trainer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sports-specific clients who require our full attention to work on a set goal.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You will receive consistent support to your training, your nutrition and mindset.
                    If you feel that you have been going around in circles and you feel you have got
                    nowhere then a structured coaching plan is recommended for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will receive consistent support in your training, your nutrition and mindset. If you feel that
                    you have been going around in circles without direction, then a structured coaching plan is
                    recommended for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a private studio session with your coach, you will go through strategic planning, creating a
                    roadmap, addressing any issues, and overcoming any battles you may come up against during your
                    fitness journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of what you will gain in your premium plan:

                        One-to-one coaching in the studio (structured times throughout the week)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Progress reviews
                    </li>

                <p class="text-title">
                    Semi-Private is an exciting new way to train as the training involves a small group of people. The
                    group environment will inspire you to keep going when it gets tough and reduces the per-person cost
                    which makes it more cost effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are coached through your program in a small group of like-minded people with everyone having a
                    programme tailored specifically to them. It is a beautiful mix of personal coaching & community that
                    develops both autonomy and a sense of togetherness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will gain a bespoke programme based on your goals and fitness level. Through camaraderie with
                    like-minded people, you will gain accountability and consistency and will stay on track with your
                    fitness goals. As the groups are designed to be small, dedicated time with your coach will still be
                    provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the group environment, you have access to several training sessions a week as opposed to one
                    or two. This is a great way to improve techniques or expedite your goals.
