[Victory Fitness - Live Website](https://ryael.github.io/victory-fitness/)

A healthy body is a healthy mind, and it is through exercise that we achieve both. However, even if the benefits of exercise are endless, it's something many struggle with due to hectic lifestyles nowadays. Between work, family, friends, and rest, it can be so difficult to find time to consistently exercise. This is where Victory Fitness comes in. Many people have this misconception that when you exercise, you need to allocate a significant amount of time to it, but the reality is that all you really need is 30-60 minutes 3 or 4 times a week. Victory Fitness puts you first and helps you find a work-out and time that suits you, no matter how busy your day to day life is. With sessions starting as early 6AM and ending as late as 9PM, there's a time that'll suit everyone. The coaches will help you stay motivated and on-track to your goals, helping you commit to a plan long enough such that you see real results.

This is my first milestone project as part of Code Institute's Diploma in <strong>Software Development (E-commerce Applications)</strong>.

After much contemplation, I decided to focus on Victory Fitness because of my own love for both exercise and the quality of the services provided by Ronan Kiely of Victory Fitness. I spoke to him directly, and he, as the founder and director, gave me full permission to base this project on his business. All logos, photos, and even some of the text content was provided to me for the sake of the project. There is an existing website but Ronan Kiely wanted to see my approach, putting emphassis on my using of some professionally taken photos.

There was and will be no exchange of funds, as this was agreed to be solely for the sake of the this project. However, I treated Ronan Kiely as my client and discussed many aspects of the website to see what he would prefer and wouldn't prefer to be included. I worked closely with him so as to make sure this website portrays the correct represenative of Victory Fitness, its brand, and its ethos.

The aim of this project is two-fold:
- To demonstrate my knowledge HTML and CSS languages, documenting my experiences, difficulities, and solutions. No other languages or frameworks were used in the development of this project.
- To adhere to the vision of Victory Fitness from a UI/UX perspective, creating a website that aptly represents this enterprise throughout all of the content and formatting.

The website is fully responsive at all screen sizes, adapting well to smaller resolutions for tablets, phones, and even landscape view on the aforementioned. It also works as intended on all popular web browsers.

This website is a multi-page website that has a consistent design throughout all its pages, and is both simple and pleasing to navigate. All of the content present adheres to Victory Fitness's vision, only contains what is necessary, such as the different coaching services available, an about section detailing the history, a contact-form and details, links to the social media, a google-map showing the location, and a gallery showcasing the inside of the gym itself.
