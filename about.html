                        The majority of the population have an unhealthy relationship with food. Some people use it as a coping mechanism to process struggles in their daily lives. Others simply don't realise the volume of unhealthy foods
                        they are consuming day in and day out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victory Fitness understands that the clients' relationship with food is crucial to their success in a fitness programme. Working out in the gym 7 days a week and wondering why you are not seeing changes? If your
                        relationship with food is unhealthy, then change will not happen.

                        Change your mindset, and everything else follows suit.
