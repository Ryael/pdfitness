            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p> PD Fitness was founded by its Head Coach, Peter Donohue, in 2017—after over 5 years in the industry, and countless personal training hours. We provide bespoke training, nutrition guidance accountability and community that strives to make fitness and health a valued and enjoyable part of your life. </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p> We take men and women that have had a stop-start relationship with exercise and “dieting”, and give them the tools, guidance, and support to not only achieve impressive short-term body transformations, but also to create the framework to keep and build upon their results for life. </p>

              <p>After years of coaching, Peter began to see repeating trends in the fitness industry:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Gyms that charge you for access to a room of complex equipment with no actual map to getting results. </li>
                <li> Chains that care more about revenue and sales than their actual members. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="coaching-right">
              <p>In August 2020, Peter alongside his wife, Shannon, opened the doors to Physical Direction fitness, costing just under €25,000. We then took that list of all the problems with the industry and put a cross through them one by one.</p>
              <p>We created a system of programming and support that allowed us to be 100% results driven (with money back guarantees to ensure we stuck with our word).</p>

              <p id="faq-first"> How do you know if we are the right Personal Trainers in Tralee to help you get from point A (where you are now), to point B (where you want to be)? </p>
              <p> For over a decade between us we’ve been helping men and women achieve results they never thought were possible, often after years of frustration and empty promises from solutions they’d tried previously. </p>
              <div id="about-questions">
                <ul>
                  <li> Have you found clothes fitting snugger and snugger each passing year, all in the “wrong” areas? </li>
                  <li> Were you shocked the last time you stepped onto the scales (or actively avoid doing so)? </li>
                  <li> Ever found yourself wheezing like you’ve just run an Ironman after climbing a flight of stairs, or attempted an impromptu kickabout in the garden? </li>
                  <li> Have you found yourself internally cringing whenever a full-body shot of you gets uploaded & you can see your physique from a less-than-flattering angle? </li>
                  <li> Do you wish you could just look forward to holidays, without dreading how you’ll feel on the beach? </li>
                  <li> Have you started to recognise that taking action isn’t all about being vain, rather being around to be active and present for your family (be it partner, kids, or (future or current) grandkids)? </li>
                  <li> Have you been discouraged by a boring training plan or bland diet in the past, and though that “dieting” & “training” just aren’t for you? </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p> If you find yourself nodding or muttering “yes” to any of these questions, there's no time better than the present to your fitness into your own hands. </p>

              <a href="" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Is This Training or Nutrition?</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p> Both! getting great results replies upon both expertly programmed workouts and looking at dietary adjustments. This is how we have created a customizable system that's so effective at helping men and women get such impressive results over the years (without boring training sessions, or bland diets). </p>
            </dd>

              <a href="" role="button" aria-expanded="false">What Kind of Results Can I Expect?</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p> Some of our most impressive transformations to date have come from our Online Clients. The flexibility to train on your own schedule with a programme that's bespoke and adjusted to your needs alongside the nutrition guidance within the Armoury Academy means within 6 weeks you can expect to be leaner, stronger, healthier and more confident with your physique than any programme of gym membership alone that you've tried before. </p>

            <dd>
              <p> All of our training is delivered directly to your phone via our coaching app. You’ll be given step by step guidance on how to use it, and it an intuitive design with video tutorials on the movement and an easy interface that allows your coach to monitor the progress you’re making. </p>
