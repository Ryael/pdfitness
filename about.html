                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                  PD Fitness was founded by its Head Coach, Peter Donoghue, in 2017—after over 5 years in the industry, and countless personal training hours. We provide bespoke training, nutrition guidance accountability and community that strives to make fitness and health a valued and enjoyable part of your life.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                  We take men and women that have had a stop-start relationship with exercise and “dieting”, and give them the tools, guidance, and support to not only achieve impressive short-term body transformations, but also to create the framework to keep and build upon their results for life.

                  <p>Peter works hand in hand with Shane Fitzgerald, who has been in the industry over 8 years. After years of coaching, Peter began to see repeating trends in the fitness industry.</p>
                  <p>Gyms that charge you for access to a room of complex equipment with no actual map to getting results. Chains that care more about revenue and sales than their actual members. </p>

                <div class="mission-right">
                  <p>In August 2020, Peter alongside his wife, Shannon, opened the doors to Physical Direction fitness, costing just under €25,000. We then took that list of all the problems with the industry and put a cross through them one by one.</p>
                  <p>We created a system of programming and support that allowed us to be 100% results driven (with money back guarantees to ensure we stuck with our word).</p>

                      How do you know if we are the right Personal Trainers in Tralee to help you get from point A (where you are now), to point B (where you want to be)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For over a decade between us we’ve been helping men and women achieve results they never thought were possible, often after years of frustration and empty promises from solutions they’d tried previously.

                          <li>
                              Were you shocked the last time you stepped onto the scales (or actively avoid doing so)?

                              Have you started to recognise that taking action isn’t all about being vain, rather being around to be active and present for your family (be it partner, kids, or (future or current) grandkids)?
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Have you been discouraged by a boring training plan or bland diet in the past, and though that “dieting” & “training” just aren’t for you?
